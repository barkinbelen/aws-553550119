Depending on the websiteâ€™s architecture and requirements (e.g., programming languages, server-side rendering, and backend needs), different cloud solutions can be applied:
- S3 Website Hosting with CloudFront: If the website is static (HTML, CSS, JS), it can be hosted on S3, with CloudFront as a CDN for faster global delivery.
- ECS with EC2 Alternatives: Instead of using an ASG with EC2 instances, ECS (Elastic Container Service) can offer better pricing and scalability for containerized applications, improving availability and reducing costs.
- Lambda for Low-Traffic Backend: For backend services with low traffic, AWS Lambda can be used to handle requests on demand.
